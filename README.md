# Plant-Growth-Predictor-using-PyTorch
This project implements a lightweight neural network to predict plant physical characteristics (phenotypes) based on environmental inputs. Specifically, it uses Linear Regression built on the PyTorch framework to model the relationship between Sunlight, Water, and a plant's final Height.
